***Note***
If you would just like to test and tweek the app then all you need is a HC-05 Bluetooth Module, 
it looks like this (I guess):

Just Power ON this device and connect to it with your phone's bluetooth and then use it with the app, although this would work but a better approach would be to connect it via arduino and then use it with the app and view data pushed on the serial monitor.
